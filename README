This is a simple chat application.

Building software
=================

Ch@t needs autotools to be compiled. In Fedora systems:

	sudo yum install autoconf automake

will install the tools needed. First of all you need to run:

	./autogen.sh

This will create the configure script that checks if your system
has the dependencies needed to built ch@t. After that:

	./configure
	make

This is create two binaries: server and client.
